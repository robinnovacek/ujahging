I want an excuse to have a large number of good aligned Kobolds that can potentially help players. So I thought what if they were in the service of a metallic dragon? However most resources I look through say nothing of their interactions with good dragons. Specifically they revere Tiamat and chromatic dragons. So how would a tribe of kobolds deal with metallic dragons? I am pretty sure they would follow the dragon as any other, but Volo's Guide makes me doubt it. If I wanted to integrate.

With the announcement of MTG Horizons, there was a question I wanted to find the answer to: how many cards does an average set add to Modern? amp#x200B; TL;DR: about 6. amp#x200B; I was a little bored last night, so I worked up a small program to grab the decklists from MTGTop8, and cards from Scryfall, to figure out just that. amp#x200B; Methodology used: I took only decklists from the last 16 major Modern events (as defined by MTGTop8) ~~and only cards from the main deck of those. –¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ Chromatics - "Tick Of The Clock". –ù–∞–π–¥–µ–Ω–æ 201819 —Ä–∞–∑. —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é Shazam - –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∏. –ü—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è; –•–∏—Ç. Chromatics are less chaotic and slightly less evil in my setting. Centuries ago, the remains of a dwarven city were inhabited by a red dragon, her dragon children, as well as a bunch of humans, dragonborns and half-dragons. The dragons rule this large city like a monarchy and keep their territory within the city walls. Despite their small size, the human kingdom respects their power and leaves them to their own devices. They invoke fear to outsiders, but protection to those allowed within Chromatics - In the City Lyrics.

A little back story: This is my first time playing DampD and I have been intentionally ignoring the Monster Manual and any information on enemies that we have not faced yet in order to keep myself from using that in game (I literally know what my character knows). Our group of 5 consists of a warlock, a ranger, a cleric/wizard multi class, a druid/barbarian multi class, and a bard/hexblade multi class (me) all lvl 4.

To tell you how fresh I am at DMing, this is session 4. We ended the previous session (3) as the crew of level 1 heroes were trying to find out why a an old rich guy's greenhouse was being invaded, and there was a hole in the ground near his house that he found to be suspect.

This started as an off-shoot of another project I was working on that ultimately got scrapped. I was trying to catalogue all locations mentioned in Desitny‚Äôs lore, but that proved to be too nebulous and ambiguous. I did, however, end up with a list of locations tied to the Last Safe City. The layout of the City has a fair bit of ambiguity, mostly because most locations in the City only have a name. We‚Äôve (sadly) never visited them, and we probably won‚Äôt in the future.

I'm slowly making up a homebrew setting as I go along, but making a big city is somewhat different from just having an evil draconian cult plotting in a village. I have a region with several human cities built around a very big lake - in ancient times a massive asteroid hit the place, so now human cities actually build their trade on fishing out gems and bits of adamantium out of the lake - hence it's called "Richlake". Worst thing to happen in recent history is the fall of great dragonborn. Enjoy millions of the latest Android apps, games, music, movies, TV, books, magazines & more.
