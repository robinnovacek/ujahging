On some rare occasions my audio in Windows 10 spikes to horrible levels. It doesn't happen frequently, just today, maybe a year ago and some times before that, but the scary problem is that I never know when it is going to happen. The volume slider doesn't increase, it stays at 30% or something but that is still unbelievable loud with distortion. If I decrease the volume to 4%, that is as high as 40% would normally be. Now I do have one tiny clue about what it could be related to. It seems. ASUS driver. ASUS Sound Card Drivers.

Need some desperate help with my Vega 64. Just picked it up and this card is performing like my old r9 390 in terms of speeds. Actually worse since my 390 was overlocked.

I'm looking to replace my Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X with comparable wireless headphones. The reason I'm looking at wireless headphones is that I am moving between my gaming PC and my sim racing rig, so cable management is a challenge because of the distance. Done a little research, but it's hard to find anything for gaming that isn't headsets. That's not what I'm looking for as I already have a wireless mod-mic, and from what I've read, headsets aren't giving you the same quality of sound. one thing you must realize is that the vast majority of all so called "gaming headsets" ARE stereo headphones running virtual surround. only a few of them have multiple drivers and plugs which can call themselves true surround sound (and even that is not like TRUE speaker surround sound exactly). also keep in mind that larger drivers on stereo sets offer greater quality typically than cheaper. I've been using these as my gaming headphones for a couple of years and love them dearly, but I'm needing to transition to something wireless, so am wondering what comes close to the sound these provide? Looking to spend up to 0, but closer to 0 preferred. Running them from an ASUS Xonar DX with Uni Xonar drivers. Thanks.
